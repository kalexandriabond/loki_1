**Eligibility screening**

1) [Eyetracking and fMRI eligibility form](http://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewFvGG2S63s8vE9)
3) RL task eligibility (can't have previously participated)
4) check if subject has ID and if not, assign from lab [database](https://docs.google.com/document/d/175AGq7DkTPlNZQH-G749gmlrRx9CNp6dACaumjPw_iw/edit)

**Criterion tasks**

1) Sex discrimination criterion (perform until .95 accurate)
2) Reinforcement learning criterion task (perform until .80 accurate)
3) Eye-tracking criterion (are their eyes trackable?)
4) If they pass the criterion tasks, then scan their heads and order a headcase.

**Enter experiment**

0) `git pull` on experiment computer
1) Something here to test whether they understand the hierarchy? (@ariaaay)
2) Perceptual learning session (baseline)
3)  - Sex disc. criterion 
    ~~- RL criterion?~~ 
    - Luminance range test (test range of pupillary response) 
    - Reinforcement learning session (x9)
4) Perceptual learning session (informed)


Note: can cut field map for RL sessions if we are running over the time allotted. Saves 2 m.

Analysis note: can use left/right motor thalamus (convergence of direct and indirect) from Aria's task as an independent measure.
