The experiment is coded in `level_cat_test.py`.

It has only 1 session, and this session has 6 runs.

Each run has 8 blocks.

Each block starts with an instruction (telling the subject which category
to match in this block). There are 5 stimuli presentation in a block: the first
stimuli is the sample greebles and the 4 following greebles are the ones to match,
which requires a button press response from the subject.

Each stimuli presentation is a 10s slow event.

Total number of stimuli per run = 5 stimuli x 8 blocks = 40.

Each run takes about 8 mins (481 s). A sample run output file can be found at
/data/BIDS/sub-9999/ses-01/func/sub-9999_ses_01_task-level_run-01_events.tsv

To run the experiment, do `python level_cat_test.py`.
If not Testing, enter '0'. Then enter the subject ID, session number and run number(1-6).
If the experiment is discontinued for some reason, you can start from any run.


Funtional localizer:
Open Matlab in the `func_localizer` folder, runs script `FFALOCPPAEBALocal.m`. 
Enter subject ID, session number and run number as above. 

There are 2 runs per sessions.
