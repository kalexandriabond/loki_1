Things to do 

output events.tsv file with time stamp for each event. rts and acc.
trial type will be the trial number 
ask Javi for more details 


two mondays from now ask about the isoluminance calibration.
 will need to move the display, and it will take a couple of hours. 
 
 
Check button presses with wand. DONE

check trigger. DONE
 
find the maximum time that each run could take and set that as the run time. will maybe need to modify the timing. DONE-ish... need to double-check. 
 

run one run all the way the way through. figure out the total timing. 
 
 what is the theoretical maximum time for each run? based on the truncated ITI distribution.
 
16 s is the max.  1.5 mandatory time within trial. 

max shouldnt be the criterion... is absurdly nonrep. 

so if the iti is predetermined, then just get the max observed iti, not theoretical according to the exponential dist. 


n_itis = n_trials - 1 Is the last iti included? Check exp. scripts. 

should be 10.2 m per run max. will have to check when they're divided by run instead of grouped.

10 min.  20 s. 

24 s over. 

400 measurements is 10 min. 11 s. 



Reduce the iti to 9 min.
