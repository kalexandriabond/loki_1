Original Greebles
Symmetric
80 Individuals
5 Families

This archive contains three-dimensional model files in 3D Studio MAx 4 format (.max) for each Greeble sorted by family and gender.

The images folder contains renderings of each Greeble from two viewpoints in TIFF format (.tif).

File names denote the individual Greeble by defining the specific origin of the body type and parts, as well as its gender.

The first character is the gender (m/f)

The second number is the family (defined by body type, 1-5)
Next there is a tilda (~)

The next few numbers describe where the parts came from in terms of the original Greebles.

The third number is the family these particular parts ORIGINALLY came from. That is, a "2" would denote that the parts in the Greeble you are dealing with came from family 2 (1-5)

The final number is which set of parts were taken from the specified family. Note that genders are never crossed (!), so that the number here only refers to the same gender parts as the Greeble you are dealing with. Depending on the number of individual Greebles in the original set, there could more more or less of these part sets (1-10, where 10 is the max possible as of August 2002).

For example, "f1~16.max" is the model of a female Greeble of family 1, with body parts from family 1, set 6.
