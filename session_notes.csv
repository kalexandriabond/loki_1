790,8/5/19,1,F,"missing last run, will collect at next session",
790,8/9/19,2,CLR / reward code 7 (8520),"collected last run but issue with connecting to the eyetracker so didn't collect RL data",
790,8/13/19,2,CLR / reward code 6 (8510),"decided to renumber the sessions on scanner in absolute terms -- starting with 2 for RL sessions. need to fix the pos. of greebles on inst. screen for perceptual criterion task. Did not dim the lights. First run was a bit rough behaviorally speaking but vast improvement on runs 2-5. luminance data were collected during the shim/anat scout for this session.",
790,8/16/19,3,CLR / reward code 3 (7510),"did the luminance range test after the shim. Representation of pupil looked a bit shaky for this session during the calibration and validation procedure. Losing the pupil during the third run. Eyetracker was moved yesterday (8/15/19) and data quality is suffering.",
790,8/30/19,4,CLR / reward code 4 (7520),"things seem to go well.",
790,9/3/19,5,CLR / reward code 7 (8520), "may need to move mirror if we can't capture the pupil. had to do that for this session. this time we moved it up farther. scott used wrong mirror (not infrared coated) so we had to start over. remind scott to use eyetracking mirror for each session. check that respiration, pulse ox, and ekg are being collected as well. went over the allotted time but previous session ran over.",
790,9/6/19,6,CLR / reward code 0 (6510), "eyetracking seemed especially stable today. May have messed up the trigger detection because shifted focus to the terminal window when teaching cristy. Triggers started to display in the terminal (4x). This was on run 4.",
